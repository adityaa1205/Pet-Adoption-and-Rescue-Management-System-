# Pet Rescue and Adoption Management Portal üêæ

Welcome to the Pet Rescue and Adoption Management Portal, a full-stack web application developed as a project during the 8-week **Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0**. The project began on August 13th, 2025.

The primary goal of this platform is to simplify the process of reuniting lost pets with their owners and to facilitate pet adoptions. It acts as a centralized and structured portal to bridge the communication gap between pet finders, owners, and administrators.
