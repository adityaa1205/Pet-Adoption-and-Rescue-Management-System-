# Pet Rescue and Adoption Management Portal 🐾

Welcome to the Pet Rescue and Adoption Management Portal, a full-stack web application developed as a project during the 8-week **Infosys Springboard Virtual Internship 6.0**. The project began on August 13th, 2025.

The primary goal of this platform is to simplify the process of reuniting lost pets with their owners and to facilitate pet adoptions. It acts as a centralized and structured portal to bridge the communication gap between pet finders, owners, and administrators.

* **🔍 Pet Status Inquiry and Search:** A robust search feature allows users to check if their missing pet is listed in the system.
* **🔔 Notifications:** An integrated notification system provides timely updates to both users and administrators regarding the status of their requests.
* **🏆 Reward System:** A version of the project was designed with a reward-based mechanism to encourage community participation in rescuing and adopting pets.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

The portal was built using a modern, full-stack architecture:

* **Frontend:** The user interface was developed using HTML, CSS, React.js, Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
* **Backend:** The server-side logic and APIs were built with Django and Django Rest Framework (Python).
* **Database:** The system uses PostgreSQL for secure and structured data management.
* **Tools:** Development and testing were supported by Postman for API testing and Git/GitHub for version control.
